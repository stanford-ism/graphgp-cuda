# graphgp-cuda


Implementation TODOs:
 - unsigned integers
 - 64 bit option
 - make sure graph, especially tree, is correct at large N. guess differences are due to tie-breaking
 - inverse and log determinant derivatives

Code improvement:
 - only do what's necessary in tree building, right now we copy too much
